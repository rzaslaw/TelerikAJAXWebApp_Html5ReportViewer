# TelerikAJAXWebApp_Html5ReportViewer

This sample provides an implementation of the HTML5 ASP.NET Web Forms Report Viewer (https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/webforms-report-viewer-controls-overview#html5-asp-net-web-forms-report-viewer) as well as a Telerik Reporting REST Service (https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/telerik-reporting-rest-conception) and a reports library that integrates .trdp (Telerik Report Definition Package) versions of some of the demos found on the Telerik Reporting Online Demos (https://demos.telerik.com/reporting).

HTML5 ASP.NET WebForms Report Viewer provides server-side wrappers for the HTML5 JavaScript ReportViewer. Developers comfortable with ASP.NET Web Forms can easily configure and work with the Report Viewer via their preferred server-side programming language.

The HTML5 Report Viewer is a client-side widget served by a running instance of Telerik Reporting REST Service. The state of the report displayed in the viewer is preserved between requests by the Reporting REST Service and having reports' cache storage is obligatory.

To configure the Reporting REST service cache you can choose between the available storage implementations - REST Service Storage Settings. The cache storage settings must be considered with the type of hosting of the Reporting REST Service.
